Welcome to the **Tanaos** Github page! At Tanaos, we enable developers to create small and efficient AI models that **don't need training data** and that run **directly on their device**, ensuring privacy and security. Our mission is to make AI accessible to everyone, everywhere.

## 🚀 Quickstart

If you are just getting started, take a look at our two open-source python libraries:

- [Artifex](https://github.com/tanaos/artifex) — generate private AI models with no training data
- [Synthex](https://github.com/tanaos/synthex) — create synthetic data for training AI models and more
